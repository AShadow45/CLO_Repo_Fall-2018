Congratulations trainee, you've passed the test [speed=20]. . .[/speed]
[speed=20]<b>Just kidding.</b>[/speed]
[/speed]To begin with, this isn't a test and as I explained earlier, this is a simulation to guide young Heroes on the right path. There is no failure here, but there is still right and wrong.
[/speed]In your case, there's more to being a hero than just [speed=20]<i>mindlessly slashing at things.</i>[/speed]
[/speed]Destroying life without paying any heed to the consequences, that is not being a hero - [speed=20]<b>that is being an utterly blind idiot.</b>[/speed]
[/speed]Heroes exist in this world to be a pillar of light, as a shield protecting the good in the world and as an unyielding sword vanquishing the evil.
[/speed]To be able to do this, you must have an understanding of these two sides, and no matter how gray it may be, you must stay true to these ideals.
[/speed]Every hero has their own set of ideals, however the purpose of this simulation is to teach you trainees the foundation of a hero before developing your own.
[/speed]And so I ask of you, do you know where your error in that situation lies?
[speed=20]. . .[/speed]
[/speed]It's a common mistake amongst you hot-blooded trainees.
[/speed]That is -
[/speed]not taking a neutral stance from the very beginning.
[/speed]A very simple method of testing this out would be to simply talk to them.
[/speed]Why don't you go try that out?
[/speed]The beauty of simulations is that there's always a chance to start again, contrary to real life.
