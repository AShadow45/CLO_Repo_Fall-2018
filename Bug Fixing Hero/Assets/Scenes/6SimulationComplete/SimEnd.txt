Congratulations trainee, you've successfully completed this simulation.
Despite your initial blunder, I'm glad you were able to acknowledge it and then to even grasp the fundamentals of a hero with ease -
I'm proud. 
Our world truly needs more heroes like you.
...
However, like everyone's journey, your training doesn't end here, in fact it never stops.
When you face the evil in the world, let your determination never falter and become the most heroic hero you could ever be.
Young hero
I wish you the best.
